### Load and plot the `penguins` dataset

The `penguins` dataset comes from Allison Horst's [palmerpenguins](https://allisonhorst.github.io/palmerpenguins) R package and records biometric measurements of different penguin species found at Palmer Station, Antarctica [@gormanEcologicalSexualDimorphism2014]. It is an alternative to the `iris` dataset example for exploratory data analysis (to avoid association of this 1935 dataset's collector [Ronald Fisher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronald_Fisher) who "held strong views on race and eugenics"). Use of either dataset will be acceptable for submission of this lab (and mention of `iris` or Fisher will be dropped for next year).

```{r}
# load R packages
librarian::shelf(cluster, dplyr, DT, factoextra, ggplot2, ggvoronoi, scales, h2o, palmerpenguins, tibble, vegan, vegan3d)

# set seed for reproducible results
set.seed(42)

```

```{r}
# load the dataset
data("penguins")

# look at documentation in RStudio
if (interactive())
  help(penguins)

# show data table
datatable(penguins)

# skim the table for a summary
#skim(penguins)

# remove the rows with NAs
penguins <- na.omit(penguins)

```

```{r}
# plot length vs depth, species naive
ggplot(penguins, aes(bill_length_mm, bill_depth_mm)) +
  geom_point()
```

```{r}
# plot length vs depth, color by species
legend_pos <- theme(
    legend.position = c(0.95, 0.05),
    legend.justification = c("right", "bottom"),
    legend.box.just = "right")

ggplot(penguins, aes(bill_length_mm, bill_depth_mm, color = species)) +
  geom_point() +
  legend_pos
```


### Cluster `penguins` using `kmeans()`

```{r}
# cluster using kmeans
k <- 3  # number of clusters

penguins_k <- kmeans(penguins %>% 
    select(bill_length_mm, bill_depth_mm), 
  centers = k)

# show cluster result
penguins_k

```

```{r}
# compare clusters with species (which were not used to cluster)
table(penguins_k$cluster, penguins$species)
```

**Bonus Question**: How many observations could be considered "misclassified" if expecting bill length and bill depth to differentiate between species?

84 observations

```{r}
# extract cluster assignment per observation
Cluster = factor(penguins_k$cluster)
ggplot(penguins, aes(bill_length_mm, bill_depth_mm, color = Cluster)) +
  geom_point() + 
  legend_pos
```

**Question 1**: Comparing the observed species plot with 3 species with the kmeans() cluster plot with 3 clusters, where does this "unsupervised" `kmeans()` technique (that does not use species to "fit" the model) produce similar versus different results? One or two sentences would suffice. Feel free to mention ranges of values along the axes.

**Answer** <br>
The kmeans() clustered the points more vertically along the x-axis than the actual species distribtion is. The majority of the Chinstrap points were split between clusters 1 & 2. From this plot, it seems that kmeans() weights x-axis values more heavily. 


```{r, eval=F, echo=F}
# **Task**: Highlight the "misclassified" points in the plot. _Hints: To get just the points misclassified, you can use `penguins_k$cluster != as.integer(penguins$species)`, which can feed as the second argument into `filter(penguins)`. To add another set of points to the ggplot, use `+ geom_point()` with arguments for: `data` with the additional points, `pch` [point shape](https://www.r-bloggers.com/2021/06/r-plot-pch-symbols-different-point-shapes-in-r/) with `fill=NA` for transparency and outline `color="red"`.

obs_mis <- penguins %>% 
  filter(penguins_k$cluster != as.integer(penguins$species))

ggplot(penguins, aes(bill_length_mm, bill_depth_mm, color = Cluster)) +
  geom_point() + 
  legend_pos +
  geom_point(data = obs_mis, color="red", fill=NA, pch=21)
```

### Plot Voronoi diagram of clustered `penguins`

This form of clustering assigns points to the cluster based on nearest centroid. You can see the breaks more clearly with a [Voronoi diagram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voronoi_diagram).

```{r}
# define bounding box for geom_voronoi()
xr <- extendrange(range(penguins$bill_length_mm), f=0.1)
yr <- extendrange(range(penguins$bill_depth_mm), f=0.1)

box <- tribble(
  ~bill_length_mm, ~bill_depth_mm, ~group,
  xr[1], yr[1], 1,
  xr[1], yr[2], 1,
  xr[2], yr[2], 1,
  xr[2], yr[1], 1,
  xr[1], yr[1], 1) %>% 
  data.frame()

# cluster using kmeans
k <- 3  # number of clusters
penguins_k <- kmeans(penguins %>% 
    select(bill_length_mm, bill_depth_mm), 
  centers = k)

# extract cluster assignment per observation
Cluster = factor(penguins_k$cluster)

# extract cluster centers
ctrs <- as.data.frame(penguins_k$centers) %>% 
  mutate(Cluster = factor(1:k))

# plot points with voronoi diagram showing nearest centroid
ggplot(penguins, aes(bill_length_mm, bill_depth_mm, color = Cluster)) +
  geom_point() + 
  legend_pos +
  geom_voronoi(data = ctrs, aes(fill=Cluster), color = NA, alpha=0.5, 
    outline = box) + 
  scale_x_continuous(expand = c(0, 0)) +
  scale_y_continuous(expand = c(0, 0)) +
  geom_point(data = ctrs, pch=23, cex=2, fill="black")
```

**BONUS Task**: Show the Voronoi diagram for fewer (`k=2`) and more (`k=8`) clusters to see how assignment to cluster centroids work.

**Answer** For `k=2`
```{r}
# cluster using kmeans
k2 <- 2  # number of clusters

penguins_k2 <- kmeans(penguins %>% 
    select(bill_length_mm, bill_depth_mm), 
  centers = k2)

# extract cluster assignment per observation
Cluster2 = factor(penguins_k2$cluster)

# extract cluster centers
ctrs2 <- as.data.frame(penguins_k2$centers) %>% 
  mutate(Cluster2 = factor(1:k2))

# plot points with voronoi diagram showing nearest centroid
ggplot(penguins, aes(bill_length_mm, bill_depth_mm, color = Cluster2)) +
  geom_point() + 
  legend_pos +
  geom_voronoi(data = ctrs2, aes(fill=Cluster2), color = NA, alpha=0.5, outline = box) + 
  geom_point(data = ctrs2, pch=23, cex=2, fill="black") +
  labs(title = "Voronoi diagram for 2 clusters")

```

**Answer** For `k=8`
```{r}
# cluster using kmeans
k8 <- 8  # number of clusters

penguins_k8 <- kmeans(penguins %>% 
    select(bill_length_mm, bill_depth_mm), 
  centers = k8)

# extract cluster assignment per observation
Cluster8 = factor(penguins_k8$cluster)

# extract cluster centers
ctrs8 <- as.data.frame(penguins_k8$centers) %>% 
  mutate(Cluster8 = factor(1:k8))

# plot points with voronoi diagram showing nearest centroid
ggplot(penguins, aes(bill_length_mm, bill_depth_mm, color = Cluster8)) +
  geom_point() + 
  legend_pos +
  geom_voronoi(data = ctrs8, aes(fill=Cluster8), color = NA, alpha=0.5, outline = box) + 
  geom_point(data = ctrs8, pch=23, cex=2, fill="black") +
  labs(title = "Voronoi diagram for 8 clusters")
```


## Hierarchical Clustering

Next, cluster sites according to species composition. Use the `dune` dataset from the `vegan` R package.

### Load `dune` dataset

```{r}
# load dune dataset from package vegan
data("dune")

# show documentation on dataset if interactive
if (interactive())
  help(dune)
```

**Bonus Question**: What are the rows and columns composed of in the `dune` data frame?

**Answer** <br> 
Columns are the species variable. Rows are the cover class observations for 30 species in 20 sites.

### Calculate Ecological Distances on `sites`

Before we calculate ecological distance between sites for `dune`, let's look at these metrics with a simpler dataset, like the example given in Chapter 8 by @kindtTreeDiversityAnalysis2005.

```{r}
sites <- tribble(
  ~site, ~sp1, ~sp2, ~sp3,
    "A",    1,    1,    0,
    "B",    5,    5,    0,
    "C",    0,    0,    1) %>% 
  column_to_rownames("site")
sites
```

```{r}
sites_manhattan <- vegdist(sites, method="manhattan")
sites_manhattan
```

```{r}
sites_euclidean <- vegdist(sites, method="euclidean")
sites_euclidean
```

```{r}
sites_bray <- vegdist(sites, method="bray")
sites_bray
```

**Question 7:** In your own words, how does Bray Curtis differ from Euclidean distance? 

**Answer** <br>
The Bray Curtis distance differs from Euclidean in several ways: <br>
- It is classified by a range of 0 to 1, where 0 is total similarity and 1 is total dissimilarity. Euclidean distance also shows similarity by numeric values closer to 0 but does not have a max value of 1. 
- Bray Curtis gives less weight to outliers than Euclidean
- The distance is weighted on the species shared between sites rather than the total number of species at a site. Euclidean is weighted on species abundance. 
- Bray Curtis is not metric, unlike Euclidean, and therefore cannot be used in the ordination methods of Canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) or Principal components analysis (PCA). 

### Bray-Curtis Dissimilarity on `sites` 

Let's take a closer look at the [Bray-Curtis Dissimilarity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bray%E2%80%93Curtis_dissimilarity) distance:

$$
B_{ij} = 1 - \frac{2C_{ij}}{S_i + S_j}
$$

- $B_{ij}$: Bray-Curtis dissimilarity value between sites $i$ and $j$. \
1 = completely dissimilar (no shared species); 0 = identical.

- $C_{ij}$: sum of the lesser counts $C$ for shared species common to both sites $i$ and $j$

- $S_{i OR j}$: sum of all species counts $S$ for the given site $i$ or $j$

So to calculate Bray-Curtis for the example `sites`: 

- $B_{AB} = 1 - \frac{2 * (1 + 1)}{2 + 10} = 1 - 4/12 = 1 - 1/3 = 0.667$

- $B_{AC} = 1 - \frac{2 * 0}{2 + 1} = 1$

- $B_{BC} = 1 - \frac{2 * 0}{10 + 1} = 1$

### Agglomerative hierarchical clustering on `dune` 

```{r}
# Dissimilarity matrix
d <- vegdist(dune, method="bray")
dim(d)
as.matrix(d)[1:5, 1:5]

# Hierarchical clustering using Complete Linkage
hc1 <- hclust(d, method = "complete" )

# Dendrogram plot of hc1
plot(hc1, cex = 0.6, hang = -1)

```

**Question 9:** Which function comes first, vegdist() or hclust(), and why? 

**Answer** <br>
In order to perform agglomerative hierarchical clustering with hclust(), you compute the dissimilarity values, using vegdist() here, to create a distance matrix. The distance matrix is a triangular matrix with all pairwise distances between sites. Then this matrix is feed into hclust() to create a cluster dendrogram. The distance values influence the shape of the cluster, thus have to be calculated first. 

```{r}
# Compute agglomerative clustering with agnes
hc2 <- agnes(dune, method = "complete")

# Agglomerative coefficient
hc2$ac

# Dendrogram plot of hc2
plot(hc2, which.plot = 2)

# methods to assess
m <- c( "average", "single", "complete", "ward")
names(m) <- c( "average", "single", "complete", "ward")

# function to compute coefficient
ac <- function(x) {
  agnes(dune, method = x)$ac
}

# get agglomerative coefficient for each linkage method
purrr::map_dbl(m, ac)

```

```{r}
# Compute ward linkage clustering with agnes
hc3 <- agnes(dune, method = "ward")

# Agglomerative coefficient
hc3$ac

# Dendrogram plot of hc3
plot(hc3, which.plot = 2)
```

**Question 11:** In your own words how does hclust() differ from agnes()? 

**Answer** <br>
It seems like hclust() has broader cluster categories than agnes(). This may be due to the fact that agnes() contains 6 agglomerative algorithms, some of which are not included in the hclust() method. The agnes() method provides more cluster heights than hcluster(). 


**Question 13:** Of the 4 methods, which is the “best” model in terms of Agglomerative Coefficient?

**Answer** <br>
Complete linkage and Ward's method are the preferred agglomerative clustering. 

### Divisive hierarchical clustering on `dune` 

See text to accompany code: _HOMLR_ [21.3.2 Divisive hierarchical clustering](https://bradleyboehmke.github.io/HOML/hierarchical.html#divisive-hierarchical-clustering).

```{r}
# compute divisive hierarchical clustering
hc4 <- diana(dune)

# Divise coefficient; amount of clustering structure found
hc4$dc
```

**Question 15:** In your own words how does agnes() differ from diana()? 

**Answer** <br>
AGglomerative NESting is the bottom-up, or from leaves to roots of the dendrogram tree, clustering approach. Divisive analysis, or divisive clustering, is a "top-down", or from roots to leaves, approach. DIANA is more accurate as it takes into consideration the entire distribution of the data when partitioning at top-levels. AGNES is good at detecting small clusters, while DIANA is effective at detecting large clusters. 

### Determining optimal clusters

```{r}
# Plot cluster results
p1 <- fviz_nbclust(dune, FUN = hcut, method = "wss",  k.max = 10) +
  ggtitle("(A) Elbow method")

p2 <- fviz_nbclust(dune, FUN = hcut, method = "silhouette", k.max = 10) +
  ggtitle("(B) Silhouette method")

p3 <- fviz_nbclust(dune, FUN = hcut, method = "gap_stat", k.max = 10) +
  ggtitle("(C) Gap statistic")

# Display plots side by side
gridExtra::grid.arrange(p1, p2, p3, nrow = 1)
```

**Question 17:** How do the optimal number of clusters compare between methods for those with a dashed line?

**Answer** <br>
The Gap statistic suggests the optimal number of clusters is 3, whereas the Silhouette method shows 4 clusters is best. There does not seem to be a definitive cluster amount using the Elbow method as the line trend has not leveled off. 

### Working with dendrograms

```{r}
# Construct dendorgram for the Ames housing example
hc5 <- hclust(d, method = "ward.D2" )
dend_plot <- fviz_dend(hc5)
dend_data <- attr(dend_plot, "dendrogram")
dend_cuts <- cut(dend_data, h = 8)
fviz_dend(dend_cuts$lower[[2]])

# Ward's method
hc5 <- hclust(d, method = "ward.D2" )

# Cut tree into 4 groups
k = 4
sub_grp <- cutree(hc5, k = k)

# Number of members in each cluster
table(sub_grp)

# Plot full dendogram
fviz_dend(
  hc5,
  k = k,
  horiz = TRUE,
  rect = TRUE,
  rect_fill = TRUE,
  rect_border = "jco",
  k_colors = "jco")
```

**Question 18:** In dendrogram plots, which is the biggest determinant of relatedness between observations: the distance between observations along the labeled axes or the height of their shared connection? 

**Answer** <br>
The height of the of their shared connection is the biggest determinant of relatedness. 

# Ordination

```{r}
# get data
url <- "https://koalaverse.github.io/homlr/data/my_basket.csv"
my_basket <- readr::read_csv(url)
dim(my_basket)
```

```{r}
my_basket
```

# Performing PCA in R

```{r}
h2o.no_progress()  # turn off progress bars for brevity
h2o.init(max_mem_size = "5g")  # connect to H2O instance
```

```{r}
# convert data to h2o object
my_basket.h2o <- as.h2o(my_basket)

# run PCA
my_pca <- h2o.prcomp(
  training_frame = my_basket.h2o,
  pca_method = "GramSVD",
  k = ncol(my_basket.h2o), 
  transform = "STANDARDIZE", 
  impute_missing = TRUE,
  max_runtime_secs = 1000)
my_pca
```

**Question 20:** Why is the pca_method of “GramSVD” chosen over “GLRM”?  

**Answer** <br>
Because the my_basket data contains primarily numeric data. When there is primarily categorical data, using the GLRM method is recommended. 

**Question 21:** How many initial principal components are chosen with respect to dimensions of the input data?  

**Answer** <br>
Forty-two principle components were chosen. 

```{r}
my_pca@model$eigenvectors %>% 
  as.data.frame() %>% 
  mutate(feature = row.names(.)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(pc1, reorder(feature, pc1))) +
  geom_point()
```

**Question 23:** What category of grocery items contribute most to PC1? (These are related because they're bought most often together on a given grocery trip)

**Answer** <br>
The category of grocery items that most contribute to PC1 is adult beverages. 

```{r}
my_pca@model$eigenvectors %>% 
  as.data.frame() %>% 
  mutate(feature = row.names(.)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(pc1, pc2, label = feature)) +
  geom_text()
```

**Question 25:** What category of grocery items contribute the least to PC1 but positively towards PC2?

**Answer** <br>
The category of grocery items that most contribute the least to PC1 but positively towards PC2 is breakfast items (milk, coffee, tea, muesli, etc.). 

# Eigenvalue criterion

```{r}
# Compute eigenvalues
eigen <- my_pca@model$importance["Standard deviation", ] %>%
  as.vector() %>%
  .^2
  
# Sum of all eigenvalues equals number of variables
sum(eigen)
```

```{r}
## [1] 42

# Find PCs where the sum of eigenvalues is greater than or equal to 1
which(eigen >= 1)
```

```{r}
# Extract PVE and CVE
ve <- data.frame(
  PC  = my_pca@model$importance %>% seq_along(),
  PVE = my_pca@model$importance %>% .[2,] %>% unlist(),
  CVE = my_pca@model$importance %>% .[3,] %>% unlist())

# Plot PVE and CVE
ve %>%
  tidyr::gather(metric, variance_explained, -PC) %>%
  ggplot(aes(PC, variance_explained)) +
  geom_point() +
  facet_wrap(~ metric, ncol = 1, scales = "free")
```

```{r}
# How many PCs required to explain at least 75% of total variability
min(which(ve$CVE >= 0.9))
```

**Question 27:** How many principal components would you include to explain 90% of the total variance?

**Answer** <br>
36 principal components would need to be included to explain 90% of the total variance.

```{r}
# Screee plot criterion
data.frame(
  PC  = my_pca@model$importance %>% seq_along,
  PVE = my_pca@model$importance %>% .[2,] %>% unlist()) %>%
  ggplot(aes(PC, PVE, group = 1, label = PC)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_line() +
  geom_text(nudge_y = -.002)
```

**Question 29:** How many principal components to include up to the elbow of the PVE, i.e. the “elbow” before plateau of dimensions explaining the least variance?

**Answer** <br>
Eight (8) principal components would need to be included.

**Question 30:** What are a couple of disadvantages to using PCA? See HOMLR 17.6 Final thoughts.

**Answer** <br>
According to Boehmke & Greenwell, traditional PCA's disadvantages include: 
- outlier influence. 
- under performance with complex nonlinear patterns. 

# Non-metric MultiDimensional Scaling (NMDS)
## Unconstrained Ordination on Species

```{r}
# vegetation and environment in lichen pastures from Vare et al (1995)
data("varespec") # species
data("varechem") # chemistry

varespec %>% tibble()
```

**Question 31:** What are the dimensions of the varespec data frame and what do rows versus columns represent?

**Answer** <br>

The dimensions of the *varespec* data frame is 44 columns of species scientific names and 24 rows of estimated cover values of the 44 species, which creates sites. The *varechem* provides soil chemistry characteristics of the 24 sites in *varespec* data.

```{r}
vare.dis <- vegdist(varespec)
vare.mds0 <- monoMDS(vare.dis)

stressplot(vare.mds0)
```

**Question 33:** The “stress” in a stressplot represents the difference between the observed input distance versus the fitted ordination distance. How much better is the non-metric (i.e., NMDS) fit versus a linear fit (as with PCA) in terms of \(R^2\)?

**Answer** <br>
The non-metric fit resulted in \(R^2\) equal to 0.977. The linear fit \(R^2\) is 0.873. The non-metric fits better by a difference of 0.104 than the linear fit.

```{r}
ordiplot(vare.mds0, type = "t")
```

**Question 35:** What two sites are most dissimilar based on species composition for the first component MDS1? And two more most dissimilar sites for the second component MDS2?

**Answer** <br>
The two sites most dissimilar based on species composition for the first component MDS1 are 28 and 4. The two sites most dissimilar based on species composition for the second component MDS2 are 21 and 5.

```{r}
vare.mds <- metaMDS(varespec, trace = FALSE)
vare.mds
```

```{r}
plot(vare.mds, type = "t")
```

**Question 38:** What is the basic difference between metaMDS() and monoMDS()? 

**Answer** <br>
According to Minchin (1987), NMDS is regarded as the most robust unconstrained ordination method in community ecology. MetaMDS() function uses monoMDS() in its calculations provide actual NMDS. MetaMDS() selects solutions with the smallest stresses. It adds species scores to the site ordination. 

# Overlay with Environment

### Environmental interpretation
- Vector fitting <br>
- Surface fitting <br>

```{r}
ef <- envfit(vare.mds, varechem, permu = 999)
ef
```

```{r}
plot(vare.mds, display = "sites")
plot(ef, p.max = 0.05)
```

**Question 40:** What two soil chemistry elements have the strongest negative relationship with NMDS1 that is based on species composition?

**Answer** <br>
The two soil chemistry elements that have the strongest negative relationship with NMDS1 based on species composition are Aluminum (Al) and Iron (Fe).

```{r}
ef <- envfit(vare.mds ~ Al + Ca, data = varechem)

plot(vare.mds, display = "sites")
plot(ef)

tmp <- with(varechem, ordisurf(vare.mds, Al, add = TRUE))
ordisurf(vare.mds ~ Ca, data=varechem, add = TRUE, col = "green4")
```

**Question 42:** Which of the two NMDS axes differentiates Ca the most, i.e. has the highest value given by the contours at the end (and not middle) of the axis? Describe in general terms (upper/lower/left/right/middle) where the highest and lowest values are found for Ca with respect to the ordination axes NMDS1 and NMDS2 (ie the ordination axes that describe the most variation of species composition between sites). 

**Answer:** <br>
The calcium (CA) vector's trajectory increases towards to upper right section of the plot and is positive on both the NMDS1 and NMDS2 axes. The NMDS1 differentiates calcium the most. Calcium values, which vary from 300 to 800 and symbolized by green lines, are highest on the center and upper right sections of the plot. 

# Constrained Ordination on Species and Environment
See supporting text in vegantutor.pdf:

## Constrained ordination
#### Model specification
Technically, this uses another technique cca, or canonical correspondence analysis.

```{r}
# ordinate on species constrained by three soil elements
vare.cca <- cca(varespec ~ Al + P + K, varechem)
vare.cca
```

**Question 43:** What is the difference between “constrained” versus “unconstrained” ordination within ecological context?

**Answer** <br>
Unconstrained ordination analyzes a single data matrix, whereas constrained ordination associates two or more data sets (Borcard 2018).

Unconstrained ordination: <br>
- displays all variation in data <br>
- useful for viewing the overall data pattern <br>

Constrained ordination: <br>
- uses prior hypothesis(es) to create plot <br>
- relates a matrix of response variables to explanatory variables <br>
- displays variation in the explanatory variable <br>
- tests hypotheses and detects data trends <br>

```{r}
# plot ordination
plot(vare.cca)
```


**Question 45:** What sites are most differentiated by CCA1, i.e. furthest apart along its axis, based on species composition AND the environment? What is the strongest environmental vector for CCA1, i.e. longest environmental vector in the direction of the CCA1 axes?

**Answer:** <br>
The sites are most differentiated by CCA1 are 28, 4.
The strongest environmental vector for CCA1 is aluminum. 

```{r}
# plot 3 dimensions
ordiplot3d(vare.cca, type = "h")
```

```{r}
if (interactive()){
  ordirgl(vare.cca)
}
```
